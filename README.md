# Hero Guy: Secret Mission
 A game similar to Mafia

# Overview

This project was built to practice and learn about building web apps using front-end and back-end technologies

Hero Guy: Secret Mission is currently the beginning to a game, similar to mafia, where each player joins on their own devices using a code provided by the host page, and then are assigned roles and have to do different things to win the game, depending on what role they are assigned. Currently, the application is a very basic version of the final game. There are only limited things that can be done.

This game is being created because the game mafia, or similar games such as werewolf, can be fun to play, but often times require a lot of people. Hero Guy: Secret Mission is being designed in such a way that hopefully it will be playable with less people, about 4 at the lowest probably.

Here is a video demonstration of the current version of Hero Guy: Secret Mission.

# Development Environment

I used VS code to program this game using Javscript. It takes advantage of peerjs and socketio to connect to the server, which is built with nodejs, and to other peers, such as from the host page to the player clients.

# Future Work

The game is almost playable. I need to make it so that there is an actual cycle of day/night, rather than just going through it once. In addition, I hope to add more roles and actions that different roles can do.
