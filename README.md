# Hero Guy: Secret Mission
 A game similar to Mafia
# Overview
This project was built to practice and learn about building web apps using front-end and back-end technologies

Hero Guy: Secret Mission is meant to be a game, similar to mafia, where each player joins on their own devices using a code provided by the host, and then are assigned roles and have to do different things to win the game, depending on what role they are assigned. Currently, the application is practically a glorified chat application.

This game is being created because the game mafia, or similar games such as werewolf, can be fun to play, but often times require a lot of people. Hero Guy: Secret Mission is being designed in such a way that hopefully it will be playable with less people, about 4 at the lowest probably.

Here is a video demonstration of the current version of Hero Guy: Secret Mission.

# Web Pages

There are two main pages for this game, first the host, which displays the game code and allows players to connect to it, and second, the player client page. Each one is navigated with buttons that mainly show and hide information that is needed or not needed depending on the situation. Each page only navigates by displaying different elements within itself. This improves speed and allows for better tracking of information between pages.

# Development Environment

I used VS code to program this game using Javscript. It takes advantage of peerjs and socketio to connect to the server, which is built with nodejs, and to other peers, such as from the host page to the player clients.
