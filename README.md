# Hero Guy: Secret Mission
 A game similar to Mafia

# Overview

This project was built to practice and learn about building web apps using front-end and back-end technologies, especially with sockets and peer to peer connections.

Hero Guy: Secret Mission is currently a very primitive game, similar to mafia, where each player joins on their own devices using a code provided by the host page, and then are assigned roles and have to do different things to win the game, depending on what role they are assigned. Currently, the application is playable, but it lacks in variety, in that it only has 4 different roles, and there are not a lot of possible actions that can be done.

This game is being created because the game mafia, or similar games such as werewolf, can be fun to play, but often times require a lot of people. Hero Guy: Secret Mission is being designed in such a way that hopefully it will be playable with a lower amount of people, especially because it will negate the requirement that one player be the narrator.

Here is a video demonstration of the current version of Hero Guy: Secret Mission.

# Development Environment

I used VS code to program this game using Javscript. It takes advantage of peerjs and socketio to connect to the server, which is built with nodejs, and to other peers, such as from the host page to the player clients.

# Future Work

The game is playable. I plan to add more roles and actions that different roles can do, which would really polish the game up a bit.
